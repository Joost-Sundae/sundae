                    Sundae Liquidity Protocol currently offers flash loans as its main feature. 
                    Flash loans are loans that are issued and returned within a single (same) transaction.
                    This page provides a function to build and execute a flash loan.
                    Before you get started it is advised to read the <a href="https://docs.sundaefinance.net/for-borrowers/flash-loan" target="_blank">documentation</a> for borrowers on Sundae platform.
                </p>

            <div class="flashloan-background">
                <h2>
                    Background on flash loans
                </h2>
                <p class="flashloan-p">
                    Flash loans are made possible due to one of Radix's key features: atomic composability. 
                    Atomic composability in Radix (and crypto in general) is the ability to combine multiple transactions into a single atomic transaction, allowing for complex transactions to be executed in a single step.
                    This enables flash loans because it allows users to borrow assets and repay the loan in the same transaction, without the need for collateral or credit checks, as the entire transaction is executed atomically.
                    Read more on atomic composability here.

            </div>

            <h2 id="borrow-title-h2">
                Here is how to get started:
            </h2>

            <div class="flashloan-steps">
                <h2>
                    [1] Connect wallet
                </h2>
                <p class="flashloan-p">
                    Connect your wallet to Sundae's dApp.
                    Install the Radix wallet on your phone and browser extension on desktop, in case you haven't yet.
                    Thereafter you can connect to Sundae's dApp by using the top right button.
                    This opens a prompt on the Radix wallet on your phone asking you to accept the connection.
                </p> 
            </div>

            <div class="flashloan-steps">
                <h2>
                    [2] Build flash loan
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Building and executing a flash loan can be broken down in three steps, as illustrated below. 
                </p>

                <h3>
                    [2.1] Get a flash loan
                </h3>
                <p class="flashloan-p">
                    Call the flash loan function on the smart contract, passing in the amount of funds you want to borrow. 
                    The smart contract will execute the loan and send the funds to your wallet.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    [2.2] Use borrowed funds
                </h3>

                <p class="flashloan-p">
                    Use the borrowed funds to execute your desired transaction or strategy. 
                    Flash loans are typically used to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities or to execute complex trading strategies.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    [2.3] Return borrowed funds
                </h3>
                <p class="flashloan-p">
                    Return the borrowed funds including interest rate to the smart contract before the end of the loan period, along with the small interest fee. 
                    Failure to return the funds and fee will result in the transaction being reverted and the borrower losing the borrowed funds.
                </p>
            </div>
            

            <div class="flashloan-steps">

                    Step 2 to 4 can be automated and executed at once by building a customized transaction manifest.
